# liquidhaskell-diagnostics

This (very simple) extension shows [Publish your extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension)'s errors in VScode "Problems" section and underlines the corresponding code.

## Requirements

This extension is based on the `.liquid` dirs that LiquidHaskell generates, so make sure to not delete those if you want to see the errors.
